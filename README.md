# Terraform AWS ECS Deploy Pipeline

## Introduction
If you have a github repository with Dockerfile, you can use this module to build an ECS that can be accessed from a custom domain.
 

Mainly works as follows:
- This module arranges CodePipeline using github as a hook and resources provisioned to it.<br>
- The deployment destination of CodePipeline is Fargate in ECS.<br>
- And ECS is linked to Load Balancer, enable access via its own domain.

## Usage
### simple usage
You can publish the github source by customizing the four values. 
 1. Application Name.
 1. Vpc and subnets to use.
 1. Port to Use(Internal and public).
 1. Github repository to use.
```main.tf
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-northeast-1"
}

locals {
  # 1. Your app name.
  application_name       = "simple-go-ping-api"
  application_name_lower = replace(lower(local.application_name), "/[^a-z0-9]/", "")
}

module "ecs-deployline" {
  source  = "ispec-inc/ecs-deployline/aws"
  version = "0.4.3"

  # 2. Your vpc and subnets id.
  vpc_id         = "vpc-0000000"
  public_subnets = ["subnet-1112", "subnet-2222"]

  cluster_name        = local.application_name
  app_repository_name = local.application_name
  container_name      = local.application_name

  # 3. Port to use
  alb_port         = "8005"
  container_port   = "8005"
  helth_check_path = "/ping"

  # 4. Your github repository.
  git_repository = {
    owner  = "murawakimitsuhiro"
    name   = "go-simple-RESTful-api"
    branch = "feature/only-ping"
  }
}
```
**warning**
 - Dockerfile should be placed at the root of the git repository to be used, and be ready to build.
 - In this simple sample, we do not link the domain or use SSL.
 
For a complete example, including a custom domain. see → [examples/api-server-ssl](https://github.com/ispec-inc/terraform-aws-ecs-deploy-pipeline/tree/master/examples/api-server-ssl)
